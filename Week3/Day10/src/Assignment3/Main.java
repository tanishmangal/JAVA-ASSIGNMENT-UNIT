		 * essential things to the user and hides the internal details, for example,
		 * sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the
		 * internal processing about the message delivery A class that is declared as
		 * abstract is known as an abstract class. It can have abstract and non-abstract
		 * methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be
		 * instantiated

		/*
		 * Important points of Abstract class:
		 * 
		 * An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword. It can have
		 * abstract and non-abstract methods. It cannot be instantiated (object
		 * creation). It can have constructors and static methods also. It can have
		 * final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the
		 * method.

	 * The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be
	 * only abstract methods in the Java interface, not the method body. It is used
	 * to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java. In other words, you
	 * can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. It cannot
	 * have a method body. Java Interface also represents the IS-A relationship.
